# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Python and JavaScript talks thanks to Socket.IO
Application.py contain server side code which listen and emits some data to client
script.js contain client side code changing and shaping look of website
styles.css contain only a few lines of styling, bootstrap4 do the rest
index.html contain structure of website. I'm planning in the foreseable future
to udpate bootstrap to its new version B5. And also add multimedia in the project.

My personal touch is supporting private messaging between two users.

ADVERTISEMENT: Sometimes, the application is buggy and you have to click on the channels
in order to see the messages (it's a fix that I need to do later).
